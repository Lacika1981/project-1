## Hi

### Few houghts to my work

It did not pass the HTML Validator as I use **picture** element in **figure** element.
I have googled for answer and find an answer on Stackoverflow. It is not official implementation yet but can be used. It causes problem when I put the **figure** element inside the **picture** element as it does not change the images when the screen size is different.
Link to the [stackoverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12899691/use-of-picture-inside-figure-element-in-html5)

Thank you
